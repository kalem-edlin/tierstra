'ISSUE001':
Need to know how to remove the first unused parameter from a function

'ISSUE002':
Perhaps an Error handling framework should be created for issues (alert or console error?)
EG throw new ExportError.nodeMissing

'ISSUE003':
Value should be the name of the tile (when information like that is carried)

'ISSUE004':
Where can I position constants so other files (dragActions) can refer to things like DELETE_TILE_DROPPABLE_ID?

'ISSUE005':
Deep copies using JSON serialization is needed as examples hold their state when the same one is reloaded! (issues when deleting)
