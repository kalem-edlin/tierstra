'ISSUE001':
Need to know how to remove the first unused parameter from a function

'ISSUE002':
Perhaps an Error handling framework should be created for issues (alert or console error?)
EG throw new ExportError.nodeMissing

'ISSUE003':
Value should be the name of the tile (when information like that is carried)

'ISSUE004':
Where can I position constants so other files (dragActions) can refer to things like DELETE_TILE_DROPPABLE_ID?

'ISSUE005':
Deep copies using JSON serialization is needed as examples hold their state when the same one is reloaded! (issues when deleting)

'ISSUE006':
removing overflow-x: scroll; will make the scroll bar only show for rows with full content. However this makes rows look uneven. Needs a fix!

'ISSUE007':
Not reeeally sure whats going on with the 0px width. Kinda forgot. Could be causing complications further down. Not worth fixing until proposed scroll alternative fix

'ISSUE008':
 The styling (sx, styles etc) logic with the calculations looks better in the return render part than in styled(component)s - alternative styling pattern case (PLZ REVIEW)
